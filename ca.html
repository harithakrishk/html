        <h1>CALICAT UNIVERSITY</h1>
        <marquee behavior="" direction="">university of calicut</marquee>
        <P>The University of <b><u><i>calicut</i></u></b> is the largest University in Kerala. Established in the year 1968, it is the second university to 
            be set up in Kerala. The University aims to nurture excellence in education and research in its catchment areas of Northern Kerala, 
            historically consigned to the periphery of Kerala’s academic map. The University lays its emphasis on fostering quality human resource
             and promoting productive research that benefit both local communities and wider humanity.The University was created through a Government plan
              bifurcating Kerala University. As per the plan, the four post-graduate departments of the University of Kerala 
            operating in Calicut were annexed to the new University along with fifty four constituent colleges spread across seven northern 
            districts.</P>
            <pre>With ‘Nirmaya Karmana Sree’ as it motto, the University has been able to surmount all challenges and emerge as the 
                largest residential cum affiliating University in Kerala. With 30 post graduate departments and 426 colleges it has become 
                a beacon of hope and enlightenment for hundreds of thousands of young men and women in North Kerala.</pre>
